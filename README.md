Thermostat App - Makers Academy Week 5

This week we started to learn about Javascript and test-drive our code through the testing framework Jasmine.

One of the challenges in week 5 was to build the business logic to model a simple thermostat, and learn to hook it up to a dynamic visual interface using jQuery - all within the browser.

How to open:

- Clone this repo to your machine and cd into that directory.
- To open the app, run open index.html in the command line.
- To run the Jasmine tests, run open SpecRunner.html in the command line.

How to use the app:

- To view the weather in your city, type in your city and click the submit page
This should then update the degrees below the input box and also show a short description of the weather.
- Click the + button to turn the temperature 'up'
- Click the - button to turn the temperature 'down'
- If the temperature is 25 degrees or higher, the Energy Usage should show 'high-usage' in red.
- If the temperature is between 18-25 degrees, the Energy Usage should show 'medium-usage' in black.
- If the temperature is lower than 18 degrees, the Energy Usage should show 'low-usage' in green.
- Click the reset button, to change the temperature back to 20 degrees.
- Click the PSM button to toggle to Power Saving Mode on/off.
- If power saving mode is on, you cannot go above 25 degrees.
- If power saving mode is off, you can go up to 32 degrees, which is the maximum temperature.
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees.

Future changes to implement

- Complete building my own web server to provide an API to persist data, using Sinatra and DataMapper.
- In the Sinatra-API branch, I have updated the Javascript user interface so that it communicates with the API through GET and POST requests, but the requests are still broken, so I will need to continue debugging this.
- It should save the selected city, its weather and description.
